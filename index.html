      <p>Hey Everyone!  I'm Jonathan Coup and I'm holding my son, Liam, who was just born June 13th. I'm currently an electrical engineer at Burns and McDonnell where I get to work with utility companies across the U.S. with their networking solutions. I'm originally from Seattle, WA. Moved to Kansas no more than a week after graduating high school in 2008 to start my new life with my wife, Sarah, who was my girlfriend at the time. Lived in Coffeyville, KS for a couple of years and took classes at the local community college. I decided to transfer to KU to go for my engineering degree. My father in law was a farmer until is early 40's and then decided to get his enigneering degree. I though if this guy can do it in his 40's after being a farmer, anyone can do it then! ...right? Yup, turns out just about anyone can do it if he and I made it through. Currently I'm a graduate student at KU wokring on my MBA, will graduate spring of 2018, just can't get enough school it seems.</p>

      <p>Since living in Kansas City I have become obsessed with bbq. I have started smoking meat myself, and I have to admit, I'm getting pretty good at it. By far brisket is my favorite and is also the hardest of the traditional smoked meats to get right. I also just love cooking in general, I make my own doughs and breads, so naturally I also make pizza. The best combination of these two though are homemade pretzel buns, fresh cut brisket, friend onions and beer cheese... It's freaking delicious! I also took up gardening this spring and the garden is getting tomatoes in, zuccini, peppers (hot and bell), strawberries, onions and a variety of herbs.</p>
